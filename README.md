# ✍️ Lekhoni: A Community-Driven Handwritten Bangla Dataset Platform

**Lekhoni** is a collaborative platform designed to build the **largest and highest-quality open-source dataset** of handwritten Bangla characters. This dataset will power OCR systems, handwriting recognition, and other AI applications in Bangla script.

🌐 Live Demo: **Coming Soon!**<br>
📦 Dataset: Coming Soon!  
🛠️ Open Source: To be released publicly

## 📚 Project Overview

Millions of people speak and write in Bangla, yet Bangla handwriting recognition remains underdeveloped due to the lack of reliable datasets. **Lekhoni** fills this critical gap by enabling users to easily contribute handwritten Bangla characters through an intuitive web interface.

Our target is to collect **200,000+ labeled images** of Bangla characters — including:
- ✅ স্বরবর্ণ (Vowels)
- ✅ ব্যঞ্জনবর্ণ (Consonants)
- ✅ যুক্তবর্ণ (Compound Characters)
- ✅ কারচিহ্ন (Modifiers)
- ✅ সংখ্যা (Numerals)

## 🔍 Why Lekhoni?

Despite Bangla’s vast usage, existing OCR systems struggle with handwritten text due to:
- ⚠️ Lack of structured datasets for handwritten Bangla characters
- ⚠️ Limited tools for collecting and labeling such data

**Lekhoni** addresses this by making data collection simple, fun, and collaborative.
